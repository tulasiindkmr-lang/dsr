# Tulasi Sales System — Starter


This repository is a simple, client-side sales data collection system designed to run on GitHub Pages or any static host. It includes:


- Login (Admin + 10 Sales Execs)
- Admin dashboard to manage master data (District, Town, Distributor, Outlet, Items)
- Sales Order form with filtered dropdowns
- Outlet Visit form
- Excel export (using SheetJS)


How to use:
1. Upload to GitHub repo.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Login as Admin: `CSADMIN` / `TULASIADMIN25`.
4. Go to Admin dashboard, add Districts, Towns, Distributors, Outlets, Items, and assign districts to sales execs.
5. Sales Executives login and fill forms.


This starter uses local JSON files and browser storage for data. You can later integrate Google Sheets or a server backend.
